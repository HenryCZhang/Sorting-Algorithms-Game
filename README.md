# Sorting Algorithms Playground (Overview)

Sorting Algorithms Playground is an educational gamified website that helps undergraduate students understand sorting algorithm(s).

## The algorithms

* [X] We started with the MergeSort as the default algorithm. The system can be designed to allow other algorithms to be added later. 
* [X] Currently we have 
* Merge Sort
* Bubble Sort

# Installation Menu

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
